NOTES

Process class containes the attributes and methods for a single process/jobs

Each CPU Scheduling Algorithms are contained in each class with the name Scheduling<algorithm>

Scheduling algorithms class contains function to make a hypothetical Gannt Chart in the format:

Take First-Come-First-Serve for example with inputs

Name | AT | BT | PRIO
     |    |    |
A    | 0  | 5  | 1
B    | 3  | 2  | 1
C    | 5  | 3  | 1

Returns a string representing the gannt chart

A 0 5 B 5 7 C 6 9

The string is pass on the JIJOFrame/output frame, and will be process to make a GUI for gannt chart and computations

TO DO'S:

Add other CPU Scheduling algorithms in the program
Fix the USER INTERFACE - not so important but this is where the beauty comes :)

just do "java MainActivity" to run the program
